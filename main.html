    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Technologist</li>
                <p>
                The word itself sounds like some righteous computer literate dude would say. Yeah, that's me. And no, I'm not a douche irl. But I can rain hellfire if there is no other choices. I like to code. Currently a cisco network and IT Essential high school student. Mother's tongue is javascript. Casual C language speaker and hate java. But will code in java if force too.
                </p>
            <li>Cubing</li>
                <p>
                If you see Jeraldy pulling out his QiYi ThunderClap 3x3 cube, he is probably practicing to become the best speed solver to ever lived. His personal record is exactly 1 minute. He is now inspiring his irl squad to also speed solve. Retired but not yet dead.
                </p>
            <li>Reading</li>
                <p>
                I like to read any books within the fiction, fantasy, and science genre. I indentify myself as a bad self writer. Currently writing a horrible book. Jeraldy also has tons of eBooks in his person computer and read atleast 1% of them in total. What an acheivment.

        Their aren't many music that interests Jeraldy nowadays...He usually prefers listening to a random programming playlist or high quality jazz music. If those two aren't revelent, he will then listen to any radio songs in your car.
